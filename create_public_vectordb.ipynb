      "Johnny Silverhand, born Robert John Linder,[3] was a famous influential rockerboy and the lead singer of the band Samurai before its breakup in 2008.[4] A military veteran who defined the rockerboy movement to what it is today, he was the most prominent figure that fought against the corrupted NUSA government and megacorporations, often being described as a terrorist. Despite being charismatic and quite the charmer Johnny is also known to be irrational, impulsive, and a manipulator.[5] Silverhand got his nickname from a cybernetic implant left arm he had installed after losing it in the Second Central American War. One of the early (and most probable) victims of cyberpsychosis, he then became very temperamental and \"on the edge\". He was described as driven by \"dedication and ambitions, but at the end of the day he doesn't care much for the people around him as long as they are used to accomplish his goals\" in one interview.[6] Eventually, Johnny was killed by Adam Smasher during the Night City Holocaust on August 20, 2023.\n",

      "Adam Smasher is a full borg solo and rival of Morgan Blackhand. He is employed by Arasaka and by 2077, has risen to the position of head of security and the personal bodyguard of Yorinobu Arasaka. Smasher is a towering cyborg, with little humanity left to be seen - not that he ever had much. After being reduced to mush by an RPG blast, Arasaka offered him a choice - either pull the plug or become a full body conversion cyborg. With little to no options and a lack of care for his human side, he agreed and became more machine than man. Adam has no empathy for others - including his fellow employees - but Arasaka kept him alive, so he lives to repay their act by killing any enemies of the corporation Arasaka puts in front of him.\n",

      "Johnny Silverhand and Kerry Eurodyne led the post-2008 resurgence of the genre with their band Samurai, and have made it onto the Top Ten. Since then, Rocker music has covered political, social, and economic activism. With the rise of cyberware, songs about technohumanism have found their way into the Rocker scene.[1]\n",

      "The '93-'94 Super Bowl saw all pretense of \"drug free\" professional sports pushed aside, with six players dying in the game. During the collapse, professional sports died for over a decade. Violent blood sports became the norm amidst the chaos. Around roughly 2002, the military government formalized augmented sports. The great stadiums of the pre-Collapse largely disappeared save for the Arrowhead complex in Kansas City, or the Giants stadium in New York; and the \"golden age\" of professional sports was considered over; with the last Olympic Games held in 1992.\n"
