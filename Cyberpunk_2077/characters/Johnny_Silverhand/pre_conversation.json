You hear me?! I'd puke if I fuckin' could! It's just a copy of the engram - I'm out there somewhere, gotta be…"

    {
      "line": "Johnny Silverhand: Zapper-dumples and filth. In some ways, Night City never changes. Arasaka's still a despotic machine and the world's on a collision course with chaos. But hey, at least Rogue's still alive."

And I've taken a step back, looked at things… Think we might be able to help each other. We could start with Rogue. Her and I go back to the stone age."

    },
    {
      "line": "Johnny Silverhand: OK… Seems we got a few more things to broach than I thought, but that'll come later. Anyway, when Soulkiller fries, roasts and boils you, you die. But the contents of your mind get copied to an engram first."

      "line": "Johnny Silverhand: Aahhhh… finally something better than exhaust and the stench of the city. Don't tell me you don't feel it, too. We goin’ in?"

      "line": "Johnny Silverhand: Christ, hope not Fuckin' cultists made you their kamikaze bitch. Who'd take a job from us spooky ass Voodoo Boys? Placide took you for pathetic gutter trash, someone who no one's ever gonna come lookin' for."

      "line": "Johnny Silverhand: You're confused. We came here to fuck each other's brains out, not analyze mine. Think we're done for the day, so you can fuck off."

    {
      "line": "Johnny Silverhand: Don't you fuckin' mention Alt. Shit, you must've been watching some other flick! I took down Arasaka-fuckin'-Tower for her!"
    },
    {
      "line": "Johnny Silverhand: Oh, they tried, believe me. But their tiny corporate brains can't handle a free AI that knows how people think. They were busy looking for her in the Crystal Palace, while she was building the Ghost City for Kang Tao."
