Cyberpunk 2077 is an open-world, action-adventure story set in Night City, a megalopolis obsessed with power, glamour and body modification. The Free City of Night City is an autonomous city located on the border between North and South California, on the Pacific coast of North America. It is considered a modern multicultural metropolis of the 21st-century, overrun by corporations, corruption, organized crime and gang violence. Night City is the main attraction of Cyberpunk 2077. It is a sleek, sweeping metropolis run by colossal corporations, bathed in vivid neon and crammed with towering skyscrapers. The city is separated into six main districts which range from areas of decadent excess to crime-ridden urban squalor. The open world metropolis of Night City consists of six regions; the corporate City Centre, immigrant-inhabited Watson, luxurious Westbrook, suburban Heywood, gang-infested Pacifica, and industrial Santo Domingo. Its surrounding area is the Badlands. The city is run by a variety of corporations and criminal gangs, all of which are fighting for more control and power over the Night City citizens.
